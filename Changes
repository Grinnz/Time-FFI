  - Fixed bugs in Time::FFI::tm->to_object where the tm object may be mutated
    and the results may be incorrect when interpreted in the local time zone.
  - Documented that the tm_mday and tm_isdst members of a new Time::FFI::tm
    record should be set explicitly.
  - Documented that mktime adjusts the tm_isdst, tm_wday, tm_yday, and possibly
    tm_gmtoff and tm_zone members of the passed tm record.
  - Initialize tm_mday to 1 and tm_isdst to -1 in the tm record returned by
    strptime, rather than the defaults of 0.
  - Added epoch method to Time::FFI::tm to return the associated Unix epoch
    timestamp.
  - Added with_extra method to Time::FFI::tm to return a new tm record with
    extra values populated.
